A small elm project which visualises the solar system in your browser.

You will need elm installed. Run using `elm reactor`.

Data for the size etc of the planets is approximately accurate, but logarithms are used to ensure everything is visible on the screen.

TODO:

- use better calculation for size/position of planet
- make planets / sun look better (textured colour?)
- add occassional random comet? Will have to use Model, possibly also Cmd
- add moons?
- add planet rings
- make planets show when in front of sun / hide when behind
